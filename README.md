There are two possable ways to install : 
1. You can click on the install link on my deployed application [here](https://lovely-olympic-01786-d338cf7b5405.herokuapp.com/) it will install on your computer and you can use the desktop link it will provide. 

2. You can `git clone` the repo, make sure you are in the file you cloned into and then run `npm install` in the terminal then `npm run start:dev` then `npm start` in the browser go to http://localhost:3000
